		Dr. John Snow (an Obstetrician) is one of the founding fathers of modern epidemiology. Although Dr. Snow was deeply involved 
		in experiments using a new technique, known as anesthesia, to deliver babies, he was also fascinated with researching his theory 
		on how cholera spread. As London suffered a series of cholera outbreaks during the mid-19th century, Snow theorized that cholera 
		reproduced in the human body and was spread through contaminated water. This contradicted the prevailing theory that diseases 
		were spread by “miasma” in the air.

		He couldn’t convince other doctors and scientists that cholera, a deadly disease, was spread when people drank contaminated 
		water until a mother washed her baby’s diaper in a town well in 1854 and touched off an epidemic that killed 616 people.
	
		London’s water supply system consisted of shallow public wells where people could pump their own water to carry home, and 
		about a dozen water utilities that drew water from the Thames to supply a jumble of water lines to more upscale houses. 
		London’s sewage system was even more ad hoc: privies emptied into cesspools or cellars more often than directly into sewer 
		pipes. So, the pervasive stench of animal and human feces combined with rotting garbage made the miasma theory of disease.

		The September 1854 cholera outbreak was centered in the Soho district, close to Snow’s house. Snow mapped the 13 public wells
		and all the known cholera deaths around Soho, and noted that spatial clustering of cases around one particular water pump on 
		the southwest corner of the intersection of Broad (now Broad wick) Street and Cambridge (now Lexington) Street. He examined 
		water samples from various wells under a microscope, and confirmed the presence of unknown bacterium in the Broad Street 
		samples. Despite strong skepticism from the local authorities, he had the pump handle removed from the Broad street pump and 
		the outbreak quickly subsided. 
		
		What he couldn’t prove was where the contamination came from in the first place.
