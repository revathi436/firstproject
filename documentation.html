Data visualization brings data to life. It plays a vital role in generating data graphically with interactive graphs, charts 
and other visual representations. In my last semester we developed a live website  using  HTML, CSS , PHP, SQL in coding. To 
implement this project, started to learn JavaScript,  D3 and SVG. I tried with the examples that are taught in the class and 
in the mean while I started searching the options to plot the graphs and map by watching videoâ€™s, tutorials and some websites. 
I listed out all the possible ways to represent the data from the given data files. Then, I started coding the map at first, 
then Time line graph and bar chart and tried the other options.

The vector map that was created gives the clear idea about where the pumps and maximum deaths has occurred. I used brown 
background for the map, gray color for streets, black dots to represent the deaths and pump icon represents the location of 
the pumps.

The Time line graph shows the number of deaths from 19th Aug to 29th Sep. For the line graph I used red color to represent 
the deaths and blue color for interactive representation of deaths for that particular day.  From the graph we can analyze 
that maximum deaths happen on Sep 1st.
 
The Bar graph shows the percentage of deaths with respect to ages. The bars are given blue color and red color is given for 
interactive representation of deaths for particular age. From the graph we can analyze that  maximum percentage of deaths 
occurred in the age group of 21-40.
